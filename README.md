## 📝 Notes for Development

- Buttons currently don't have active functionality; these should be connected to sign-up forms or other pages
- All social media links in the footer are placeholder links that should be updated
- The design uses absolute positioning for some elements; ensure responsive testing on mobile devices
- Font loading from Google CDN ensures optimal typography rendering
